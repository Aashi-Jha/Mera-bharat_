                <br><br>
                <h2>WHERE IS INDIA??</h2>
                <p>Answer-
                    Asia
        
                    1.8 Geographical India: India is a vast country in the Southern portion of Asia which is bound by Indian Ocean on its south, Arabian Sea on its west and Bay of Bengal on its east and borders Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, China and Bangladesh on its north, northwest, northeast and east.</p>
                    <br><br>

           <h2>What are the best months to visit??</h2>
                    <p>The best time to visit India is between October and March, when the weather is more likely to be warm, sunny, and dry. During this time, the north offers clear blue skies.</p>
                    <br><br>

                    <h2>What do I wear in India??</h2>
                    <p>Both men and women travelers should have pants and avoid tank tops as clothes to wear in India. In India, attire for women (if you really want to look like a local) includes long skirts that go down to the ankle instead of pants. While T-shirts are acceptable, always err on the side of modesty.</p>
            <br><br>

<h2>What attracts tourists to India??</h2>
<p>The main reason why India is famous for tourism means all type of tourist destinations in one place. India is the right place for wild safaris, desert safaris, nature seeking places, honeymoon spot, adventurous activities, spiritual places, and historical places of India.</p>
<br><br>

<h2>Iâ€™ve never been to India.Where should I go first??</h2>
<p>I humbly suggest The Golden Triangle. Located in North India the triangle connects the national capital of Delhi, the pink city of Jaipur and the home of the Taj Mahal the city of Agra. I found it to be one of the most easily accessible travel journeys with many options of transportation between the cities. It provides you with a great glimpse into the country but also tons of amazing sights to see even if you are on a time constraint.</p>
<br><br>

<h2>What is the cheapest Airport/City to fly into??</h2>
<p>Indira Gandhi International Airport â€“

    Flights from the US to Delhi can be found for around $700-1100 round trip but I have seen deals for as low as $500 round trip. Word of warning Delhi sometimes can be covered in fog, which can delay flights.</p>
<br><br>

<h2>How was the Language Barrier??</h2>
<p>I never had a problem at any hotel, landmark, or airport finding people that spoke perfect English. Same goes for the drivers and guides we hired. Some spoke better English than us and at the very very minimum  they will speak easily understandable broken English.</p>
<br><br>

<h2>How Crowded is India??</h2>
<p>India has one of the largest populations at 1.2 billion. Now add in tourists and youâ€™ve got a lot of people in one place. So yes, it will be crowded. Not to mention Indians donâ€™t really understand personal space. So yes it will be crowded when seeing major sights and exploring the markets and cities.</p>
      <br><br>  

<h2>Do I need a Driver/Guide Everywhere I go??</h2>
<p>No definitely not! But here are my thoughtsâ€¦ India is extremely inexpensive, so hiring a driver all day is a great way to see the cities on limited time. Plus it makes everything just a little bit easier. In Delhi a driver for 8 hours was around $24. As for a guide if you are into history and tons of facts while you travel this is the best place to have a guide everywhere you go!</p>
<br><br>

<h2>What is the Food like??</h2>
<p>If you are a vegetarian you will LOVE India. There are so many options you will probably be overwhelmed. If you eat meat donâ€™t worry most restaurants have a meat section unless it is marketed as a vegetarian restaurant. Cows are sacred in India and in Rajasthan it is completely outlawed to sell their meat, even to tourists, so you may have to eat chicken burgers while thereThe food is spicy but most restaurants cater to tourists and tone down the spice. But their version of normal spice is still very spicy for most westerners. That being said if you are extremely sensitive to spice eat with caution. If you let them know when you arrive they usually can make something devoid of spice.    .</p>
<br><br>

<h2>Are there any cool Festivals to plan my trip around??</h2>
<p>YES! If you can visit during Holi (festival of colors) or Diwali (festival of lights) you will have a ridiculously amazing time.

    UPCOMING HOLI DATES:
    March 29 2021 // March 18 2022 // March 8 2023
    UPCOMING DIWALI DATES:
    November 4 2021 // October 24 2022 // November 12 2023
    </p>
    <br><br>

<h2>What is India's official name??</h2>
<p>India's official name is 'Bharat' in Hindi and 'Republic of India' in English.</p>
<br><br>

<h2>How much will I spend? Iâ€™m going for six months.</h2>
<p>I think you would be safe to say 1,000 USD a month if you are traveling like a bum backpacker which is what I did a couple years ago on my first trip. I never chose the higher priced option, always stayed in the cheapest guesthouse (usually anywhere from 4-10 USD and luckily could split that with a friend for one month). I feel like each year the prices go up and I donâ€™t know if youâ€™ll get these same prices.</p>
<br><br>

<h2>What are the best budget airlines in India??</h2>
<p>In general, I search on Kiwi for all my flights since it includes budget airlines and doesnâ€™t rely on code sharing.

    My guide to budget airlines in India could prove helpful if you want to know what airlines are ranked higher than others. They are pretty much all the same, though.
